THis program sorts your school notes into their respective folders for you

#TO-DO:
- Change default selection to only allow unpicked documents (pdf, txt, docx)
- Move dictionary to separate file or json for abstraction
- Ignore skipped files during subsequent checks
- Convert into both cross-compatible and platform specific executables
- Implement auto startup through either cronjobs or services
- Implement relative paths for folders
- Create folder structure if it doesn't exist and preferentially use it
